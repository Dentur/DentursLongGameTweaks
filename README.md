# Denturs Long Game Tweaks
[Factorio Mods](https://mods.factorio.com/)

Playing Factorio on hard build settings can be quite fun, but some aspects could be improved.
This mod tries to improve these aspects.

## Target Group
This mod is targeted at expirienced players who try to challenge themselfs with
hard production settings. Like hardcore recepies, plenty of Mods like angles or
bob and additional pre game modifiers. If you belong to those people, or simply
want an easier game, this mod is for you.

## Current Changes
### Worker Cargo Size
If your base becomes realy large, you may find that you need to many robots on
the map to provide enough resources to your production line. So this mods
provides extra research that allows to increase the Robot Storage Size
(Cargo Size). This research will cost a lot of basic resources but does only
slowly increase to later science packs.
